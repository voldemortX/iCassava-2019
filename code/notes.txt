dev: 1129
train: 4527
classes: 5(Quite unbalanced)
resolution: Various(Currently resized to 224x224, higher resolution doesn't seem to help at this point)
baseline: ResNet-18/vgg11 finetune, doesn't seem to work at all,
          overfits right after 1st epoch, cv acc around 46%, fu*k this!
          Though somebody reached 66% with mobileNetV2...
          Why don't we have this kind of compact model in PyTorch?
